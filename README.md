=======================

UI pattern implementations for Android apps.

There are several beautiful awesome UI in mobile apps.  
But it's sometimes too difficult or too expensive (because it requires so much time) for us to implement by ourselves.  
This project helps you to implement that kind of UI patterns.  
Just copy your favorite to your projects!
